# Simulation code and data 

In this README will descriptions on how to use the simulation code "zeeman_ycalc_azi.py" and also how the data is 
packaged in the .hdf5 files as well as the script *plot.py* that is used to create all graphs in the paper

## Simulation code 

The simulation code found in "zeeman_ycalc_azi.py" and runs fully in python. To install the necessary dependencies 
I suggest to use miniforge3 and mamba see: [https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) and follow the installation guide.

Using LINUX/MacOS you can then easily install all the dependencies using mamba or conda with the environment file 
"environment.yml". This is done through the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mamba env create --name simulation --file environment.yml
````

All dependencies will then be installed in the environment "simulation". To activate this environment simply 
type the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mamba activate simulation
```

Now you can run the simulation from the terminal with:

```bash
python zeeman_ycalc_azi.py
```

The simulation will be done with four different lines of sight where the azimuth angle will vary between the 0°, 90°,
180° and 270°. The zenith angle will remain fixed at 77.6° mimicking our measurement lines of sight. When the script 
have finished you will the results of the simulation be saved under "hdf5/simulation"

## File and variable description 
### Simulations 

The simulations are saved as hdf files in hdf5/simulations. The filenames indicate what azimuthal angles used for example, 
"ycalc_O2_0.hdf5" contains the data for the simulation where the azimuth angle was 0° and so on. The files are hdf files 
and I suggest the python library h5py to read them, see: https://docs.h5py.org/en/3.12.1/ for the documentation. The keys 
in these fields are the following:

| Key name          | Description                 | 
| ----------------  | --------------------------- |
| I                 |  Intensity of the radiation |   
| Q                 |  Stoke component for the linear polarized radiation (vertical and horizontal) |
| U                 |  Stoke component for the linear polarized radiation (45°) |
| V                 |  Stoke component for the circular polarized radiation (right and left hand) |
| f                 |  Frequency array in Hz|
| azi               |  Azimuth angle in °|


### KIMRA Measurements 

As for the simulations are the measurements also saved in hdf format and can also be read with the h5py library. The files
are associated according the following:

| Filename                                | Description                 | 
| --------------------------------------  | --------------------------- |
| Data_2024-01-04_03-35-09_RPGFFTS.hdf5   |  Measurement at 0° azimuth angle (North)|   
| Data_2024-01-04_05-36-27_RPGFFTS.hdf5   |  Measurement at 180° azimuth angle (South)|   
| Data_2024-01-04_15-06-38_RPGFFTS.hdf5   |  Measurement at 90° azimuth angle (East)|   
| Data_2024-01-04_16-07-17_RPGFFTS.hdf5   |  Measurement at 270° azimuth angle (West)|   
| kimra_RPGFFTS_2023-12-02_01-40-04.hdf5  |  Measurement at 90° azimuth angle (East)|   


The data is saved under the key "kimra_data" and holds the following keys:

| Key name          | Description                 | 
| ----------------  | --------------------------- |
| azimuth           |  azimuth angle for the line of sight|   
| date              |  start date of the measurement|
| f                 |  frequncy array from the measurement |
| integration       |  number of integrations for the measurement |
| gas               |  gas tag tied to the measurement|
| integration-time  |  time spent for the integration, in ms|
| p_grid            |  pressure grid collected from ECMWF |
| record-number     |  integer associated with the raw data file |
| source            |  file path to the raw data file on the server |
| spectrometer      |  spectrometer used |
| t_field           |  temperature grid collected from ECMWF|
| time              |  start time for the measurement

| z_field           |  altitude grid calculated from the pressure grid
|za                 |  zenith angle for the line of sight |

### Magnetic field measurements

The magnetic field measurements are being conducted continuously at IRF and we are 
interested in the strength of the magnetic field since it influences the line split 
in the Zeeman splitted transition

| Filename                                | Description                 | 
| --------------------------------------  | --------------------------- |

| magfield.hdf5                           |  File containing data only from January 4th to 5th, 2024 and shifted from UTC to CET|   
| kir202302dsec.sec                       |  Raw data file from magnetic field measurement for the whole month of January 2024 in UTC|   
| magfield.hdf5                           |  File containing data only from Demember 2 to 3, 2023 and shifted from UTC to CET|
